## Performance Audit

We benchmarked the app using **Google Lighthouse** before and after our performance optimisations  
(`React.memo` + route-level `React.lazy` loading for Admin Panel).

### Optimisations Applied
- **React.memo** on heavy components (`VisitorStatsChart`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Dynamic imports** + `React.lazy` with `Suspense` for Admin Dashboard routes (code-splitting)
- Reduced **Total Blocking Time** by deferring heavy JS parsing
- Minified component props & reduced reactivity overhead


### Results Overview
| Page & Mode              | LCP Before | LCP After | Improvement |
|--------------------------|-----------:|----------:|------------:|
| **Landing â€“ Mobile**     | 2.2â€¯s      | 1.9â€¯s     | **13.6% faster** |
| **Admin â€“ Desktop**      | 1.2â€¯s      | 0.5â€¯s     | **58.3% faster** |
